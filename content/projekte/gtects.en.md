With a custom-developed software, it became possible to read, automatically analyze, and clearly display files in the
standard format for crystallographic structures (CIF). A particular focus is on calculating topological symbols for
characterizing structures modeled by periodic (directed) graphs. All implemented algorithms were made available as a
class library.

The mathematical theory of this software was the content of my diploma thesis. The software GTECS3D, which is based on
the library, has been used to analyse chemical structures.
