After the relaunch of a webshop, it was necessary to test and analyze its behavior under heavy load. Due to the limited access to average values of the previous shop's usage, a suitable statistical model for calculating a realistic load profile was initially developed. This resulted in a JMeter plugin.

In addition to performance tests under realistically calculated load, overload and failover scenarios were also conducted.

##### Contribution
