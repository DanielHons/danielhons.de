The "ExerCite" application was developed by me during my time as a research assistant at the Department C for
Mathematics in Aachen. The software allows for capturing, managing, and thematically grouping mathematical exercise
tasks.

With the help of the application, exercise sheets and sample solutions can be generated from a selection of tasks and
assigned to lectures. The software also includes the rendering of mathematical formulas using LaTeX.
