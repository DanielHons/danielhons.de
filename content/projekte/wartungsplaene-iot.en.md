For an IoT platform designed to connect large industrial equipment, I developed an algorithm that utilizes data from various sources to plan maintenance tasks in advance. My expertise in algorithm design played a crucial role in this project. Due to the large number of machines involved, performance considerations were particularly important. By optimizing the algorithm, a significant performance improvement of over 1000% compared to the previous solution was achieved.
