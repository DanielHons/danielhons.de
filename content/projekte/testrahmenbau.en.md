An already in-production software required additional (local and hosted) environments for the development process. Following an initial analysis of the system, the necessary infrastructure was planned, provisioned, and populated with initial data. The local environment and parts of the remote environment are based on Docker (-compose).

Deployments to the environments are partially automated via code management (Git/Bitbucket).

Kubernetes was not used.

Additionally, test data management scripts were provided to the development team.
