After the software was handed over to my client by a previous service provider with a variety of gaps following two years of development, it consisted of a web application with an Angular frontend and a Spring-Boot backend in a Kubernetes cluster. Integration and deployment were carried out through a CI/CD pipeline. I was assigned to a new team to complete the partially finished software and facilitated workshops to align the current requirements with the state of the implementation. Within 12 months, my team and I managed to revise the existing system and successfully transition the application into production, where it remains in operation to this day.

##### Contribution
- Consultation on revising the existing, partially finished system
- Analysis and collection of requirements for improving the system
- Adjustment of system architecture
- Implementation and optimization of the backend
