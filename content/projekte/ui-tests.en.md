I developed and implemented test utility libraries for different applications and technologies, creating interfaces between program code (the implemented test cases) and the user interface of an application in the form of [Page Objects](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html).

Additionally, the following challenges were addressed in this context:
- Email sending and analysis within the scope of tests
- Clarification of requirements
- Software quality analysis according to [ISO/IEC 9126](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_9126)
- Testing localization vs. internationalization (l10n and i18n)
- Test data management
- Robustness against external influences (such as network failures)

##### Contribution
- Consulting on test case creation
- Design of test utility libraries
- Coaching
- Implementation
